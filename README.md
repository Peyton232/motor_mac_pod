## Deployment

Every time the `MotorMac.xcframework` is upgraded from [sonr-io/sonr](https://github.com/sonr-io/sonr), we bump the major tag version of this podspec. This is because the `MotorMac.xcframework` is not backwards compatible with previous versions.

## Installation

motor_pod is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'motor_mac_pod'
```
